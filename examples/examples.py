    # example 1: show basic functionality (use of different refrigerants, source/sink fluids, use of different libraries)
    
    
    
    # example 2: show how to include compressor data (n_comp(PR))
    
    
    
    # example 3: apply to practical problem of interest
    #  - find cycle that produces desired Qcond, and report COP & compressor speed
    # WORK ON THIS FIRST! THEN EX 1 AND 2 WILL BE EASIER TO DO.
